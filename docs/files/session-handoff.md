# Session handoff: chrome_cis

**Read this first when you continue on another machine or in a new Claude session.** It says where the work stopped,
how we think about it, how Claude should work with you, and what to do next. Last update: **2026-10-08**.

New Claude session: say *"read `chrome_cis/docs/session-handoff.md` and `chrome_cis/docs/CLAUDE.md` first"*.

## 1. Where we are (2026-10-09)

The role is built in the **Ansible Lockdown layout** (team review: follow Lockdown / `mongodb8_cis` best practice)
and lives on **`staging`**. Design: [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md) D3 revised, D15.

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Benchmark, requirements matrix, discovery, decisions D1–D15 | Done |
| Lockdown build: 5 sections, one task per rule (118 rule tasks) | Done; lint passes; container tests in [work-log.md](work-log.md) items 35–39 |
| Browser choice (Chrome / Chromium) and exact version | Done (D15); containers: Chrome pinned 144, Chromium from EPEL 8/9 |
| VM tests | Chrome Level 2 OK; Chrome 144 run showed the N/A policies as "Error" (unknown); Chromium and Chrome 143 on a VM still to do |
| README, compliance record | Next |

## 2. Structure

```
tasks/main.yml              prelim (always) -> install (opt-in) -> section_1..5 (switches) -> post (always)
tasks/prelim.yml            version/OS checks, package_facts, stop if the browser is missing, start the policy set
tasks/install.yml           Chrome: Google key, repo, package or exact-version RPM; Chromium: EPEL key, epel-release, chromium
tasks/section_<n>/main.yml  imports the cis_<n>.x.yml files of that section
tasks/section_<n>/cis_*.yml one task per CIS rule, benchmark order
tasks/post.yml              write chrome_cis.json (one copy), short report
```

Each rule evaluates itself and adds its policy; `post.yml` writes one file:

```yaml
- name: "1.1.1 | PATCH | Ensure 'Cross-origin HTTP Authentication prompts' is set to 'Disabled'"
  when:
    - chrome_cis_level_1
    - chrome_cis_rule_1_1_1
  tags: [level1, automated, patch, rule_1.1.1, http_auth]
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    chrome_cis_policies: "{{ chrome_cis_policies | combine({'AllowCrossOriginAuthPrompt': false}) }}"
```

- **Full run:** the policy set starts empty, so `chrome_cis.json` matches the settings (rule off = removed).
  **`--tags` / `--skip-tags` run:** starts from the current file (prelim `slurp`), only the selected rules change.
- **Site rules:** run only when the site value is set (`is not none` / `| length > 0`).
- **N/A rules (14 with a Chrome policy):** normal tasks, tag `not_applicable`, switches **on** by default, grouped at
  the end of `defaults/`; Chrome 144/155 shows them as "Error" (unknown policy), so a site sets `false` where its
  version doesn't support them. 2.1.1/2.1.2 (Google Update): comments only.
- **4.12:** own task, same policy as 4.1.1, follows `chrome_cis_rule_4_1_1`.
- **Browser / version:** `chrome_cis_browser: chrome | chromium`, `chrome_cis_version: ""` (exact version; Chrome:
  Google keeps about a year, oldest today `143.0.7499.40`, W-5; Chromium: EPEL keeps only the current one, EPEL 8 is
  frozen at 133). The role never downgrades.
- **Tailoring for users:** `group_vars` only: browser, version, install, levels, `chrome_cis_section1..5`, one
  `chrome_cis_rule_<id>` per rule, site values (under their rule in `defaults/`).
- **Removed on purpose (user decisions):** the role-settings assert, the conflict check for other policy files
  (not CIS scope), the long report.

## 3. Branches (`github.com/bunnywkwk/chrome-cis`)

| Branch | Holds |
|--------|-------|
| `staging` | **the role** (Lockdown layout), used by the test project (`requirements.yml` → `version: staging`) |
| `main` | first commit only; merge `staging` into it when the role is released |

The data-driven variants (rule list + Jinja loop, `set_fact` loop, baseline JSON files) and the `lockdown` work
branch were deleted on 2026-10-09 (local and GitHub); their reasoning stays in design-decisions D3 and the work log.

## 4. Next steps

1. VM tests from `pre-chrome`: Chrome 143.0.7499.40 (`chrome_cis_version`), Chromium (`chrome_cis_browser:
   chromium`); check `chrome://policy`; decide whether the N/A switches stay on by default.
2. README (CLAUDE.md "End-user experience"), compliance record, screenshots indexed in `test-results.md`.
3. Merge `staging` into `main` when released.

## 5. The mindset (why the role looks like this)

| Principle | In this role |
|-----------|--------------|
| **The benchmark is the source of truth** | only the 118 CIS rules; never extra Chrome policies; CIS IDs never renumbered |
| **Evidence, not assumption** | every "works on RHEL" / "N/A" claim is backed by Google's policy template for Chrome 155 (Ctrl+F search text per rule) **and** a VM test. Don't add new sources mid-way |
| **The benchmark is written for Windows** | PDF printed p. 8–9 (viewer p. 9–10): Group Policy / registry. On RHEL the same **policy names** go into a JSON file in `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/` |
| **One task per rule (Lockdown)** | each CIS rule is its own task with name, toggle, level and tags; it adds its policy, `post.yml` writes one `chrome_cis.json` (D3 revised 2026-10-09) |
| **Full CIS by default, exceptions in `group_vars`** (2026-10-08) | L1 on, L2 off; the 12 risky rules are **on** with a `# WARNING:` saying what breaks; the site turns off what it can't accept (`chrome_cis_rule_4_7: false`), so `group_vars` = the compliance record's exception list. Applies to future roles too (CLAUDE.md principle 3). `mongodb8_cis` keeps the old "risky = false" |
| **Site values** | rules where CIS lets the organization decide (Manual): `null`/`[]` = report only; set = written (D6) |
| **All 118 accounted for** | N/A rules stay in the list with a reason and appear in every report |
| **No Chrome version pinning** | Google's repo keeps only the latest build per channel; policies work by name on any version (D10). Channel = one variable |
| **Don't over-engineer** | simple inputs only (one value or a flat list); no browser restart; no SELinux tasks |

## 6. How Claude works with you (keep this the same on every machine)

| You prefer | So Claude |
|------------|-----------|
| Learning by typing | you hand-type `tasks/` (and the computed vars); Claude gives code in a **guide or in chat**, block by block, each with a one-line **what** and **why**; never writes your task files unless you ask. If you say "I'll do it", Claude gives code + steps, no files |
| Plain words | simple English, tables, short answers; you have a Python background, so Python comparisons help |
| Snippet questions | when you paste a snippet, explain only that syntax, 3–8 lines with a tiny example |
| Honest answers | Claude says when something isn't verified, when it was wrong, and pushes back with a reason (e.g. risky defaults), then follows your decision |
| Simple options | one value or a flat list per option; complex per-item inputs → report-only + a documented hand fix |
| Reverts | when you say "revert", Claude reverts fully, no arguing |
| Review | after you type a file, Claude reviews it against the tested code, fixes or lists typos, runs `yamllint` + `ansible-lint` |
| Evidence | you drop screenshots, say "check it"; Claude reads each image, checks the command is right, renames `NN-<os>-<scenario>-<result>.png`, indexes it in `test-results.md` |
| Docs | Claude writes all docs; every doc has what / why / evidence; decisions changed → marked "Revised <date>"; **no emojis** (Pass / Fail / N/A / Yes / No) |
| Standup | short entry per day in `docs/standup.md` |
| Safety | Claude never commits or pushes unless asked, names every commit it makes, and **never adds a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line** (user decision 2026-10-09); never hardens your workstation (commands for it are given to you to run); never commits CIS PDFs/spreadsheets |
| Errors | every error gets a troubleshooting entry with the exact output, cause, fix, prevent |

## 7. `defaults/main.yml` and `vars/main.yml`

**`defaults/main.yml`** (unchanged by the rebuild): install + channel, `chrome_cis_level_1/2`, 11 site values + 2
allowlists (`null`/`[]` = report only), 101 `chrome_cis_rule_<id>` toggles (12 risky ones with `# WARNING:`, on by
default). **`vars/main.yml`**: internal values only (repo, policy folder, installed Chrome); the rule list and the
status loop go away in the rebuild.

## 8. Facts to remember

| Fact | Where proven |
|------|--------------|
| Chrome 155.0.8059.39 on RHEL 8.10 / 9.7 / 10.2: same behaviour, no OS branches | platform-notes D-1..D-4 |
| The RPM doesn't create `policies/managed/`; the role does | D-2 |
| Installing by hand doesn't import Google's key (rpm lock) → role imports it first | T-C1 |
| "Chrome Enterprise" on Linux = the same RPM + policies; all channels in the same repo, one build each | platform-notes W-2 |
| All 101 applicable policies OK in `chrome://policy`; `ProxyMode` "Deprecated" but works | D-4 |
| 4.7 DoH "secure" without `DnsOverHttpsTemplates` breaks all browsing | user-view.md, 2026-10-08 |
| Some policies load only at Chrome start; the role never restarts Chrome | D11 |

**Still open (small):** desktop session type (X11/Wayland) for 4.1.1/4.12; beta/canary read the same policy folder
(expected); 5 N/A rules not yet loaded on a VM; README (batch 6); maybe make 1.9 a fixed rule instead of a site
value (only one CIS value); maybe add a DoH site variable next to 4.7 (CIS note) later.

## 9. Environment

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| VMs (Proxmox) | rhel8 `192.168.20.50`, rhel9 `192.168.20.30`, rhel10 `192.168.20.40`, "Server with GUI"; SSH user `frqadmin`, key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_cis` |
| Snapshot | **`pre-chrome`** on all 3; revert before each clean test |
| Control node | ansible-core 2.16 venv `~/.ansible-2.16.1-env` ([control-node-setup](../../docs/control-node-setup.md)); **activate it first** (T-C2); no collections needed |
| Lint | `yamllint . && ansible-lint --offline` inside `chrome_cis/` (uv tools) |
| Benchmark files | `cis-pdf/`, `cis-spreadsheet/` at the repo root; **never commit them** |
| Standup notes | [docs/standup.md](../../docs/standup.md) |
| Container test | Rocky 8/9/10 with podman + `containers.podman` (test only); recipe below |

### Optional: Claude's container test
