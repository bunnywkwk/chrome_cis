# CIS Google Chrome Benchmark v3.0.0: plain-language summary (planning)

**What:** every recommendation in the benchmark, with what it sets, why CIS wants it, what users will notice, and a
first planning note for the role. **Why:** to skim the benchmark before designing the role (workflow phase 1,
[role-workflow.md](../../docs/role-workflow.md)). This is a reading aid, not the requirements matrix: that comes next
(`cis-requirements.md`) after the open questions below are answered and discovery is done.

**Source:** `cis-spreadsheet/CIS_Google_Chrome_Benchmark_v3.0.0.xlsx` (sheet *Combined Profiles*: title, profile,
status, rationale, impact, audit, remediation, default value) and `cis-pdf/CIS_Google_Chrome_Benchmark_v3.0.0.pdf`
(Overview, pages 8–9). Rationale and impact are condensed into my own words; the CIS wording is in the spreadsheet.

## 1. Facts about this benchmark that shape the plan

| # | Fact | Evidence | What it means for us |
|---|------|----------|----------------------|
| F1 | **118 recommendations**: Level 1 = 88 (77 Automated, 11 Manual), Level 2 = 30 (28 Automated, 2 Manual) | spreadsheet count | far bigger than MongoDB (23), but almost every rule is the same kind of thing: one policy = one value |
| F2 | Written for **Windows Group Policy on AD-domain-joined machines**; every Audit is a registry value under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome` | PDF printed p. 8 (viewer p. 9): "This Benchmark assumes the installation of the Google Chrome and Google Update ADMX/ADML templates into the Active Directory policy store"; printed p. 9 (viewer p. 10): "designed to use Windows Group Policy on a domain joined system to set the appropriate Windows registry values", "written for Microsoft Windows Active Directory domain-joined systems using Group Policy… Adjustments/tailoring to some recommendations will be needed" | no Linux commands in the benchmark. We translate each rule to its **Chrome policy name** (the registry value name) and check on each RHEL version that Chrome accepts it (platform-notes D-3) |
| F3 | On Linux, Chrome reads the **same policy names** from JSON files in a "managed policies" directory; `chrome://policy` shows the effective result on every OS | PDF p. 9 says CIS settings end up as Chrome "policies" visible in `chrome://policy`. Linux path to **verify in discovery** (expected `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/` for Google Chrome, `/etc/chromium/policies/managed/` for Chromium) | strong hint for a **data-driven role**: one rules-as-data file rendered into one JSON policy file. To be confirmed and justified in `design-decisions.md` |
| F4 | **"Enforced Defaults"** (section 1): many rules set what Chrome already does by default. CIS sets them anyway so **the user can't change them** and scanners can check them | PDF p. 9 "Enforced Defaults" | most of section 1 has **no user impact**; it just locks the default |
| F5 | Policy value types: boolean (`0`/`1` in registry → `false`/`true` in JSON), integer (`2` = block, etc.), string (`"secure"`), list (`ExtensionInstallBlocklist: ["*"]`), and "must **not exist**" (rules saying 'Disabled' for a list policy) | Audit column of each rule | the data file needs per-rule type; "must not exist" rules = **don't write the key** (and remove it if present) |
| F6 | Some policies are for Google Update, Windows-only AD features, or retired Google services | rule text (e.g. 2.1.1 "available only on Windows instances that are joined to … Active Directory") | each rule gets a status `applies` / `na_os` / `manual`, **verified** against Google's policy list "Supported on" (CLAUDE.md "classify with evidence") |
| F7 | Level 2 **extends** Level 1 (High Security, "limited functionality") | Profile Definitions | same gating as `mongodb8_cis`: `level_1` on, `level_2` off by default |
| F8 | Tested against **Chrome v120** | PDF p. 8 | some policies may be renamed/removed in current Chrome; discovery checks each against the installed version |
| F9 | **4.1.1 and 4.12 are the same policy** (`ScreenCaptureAllowed = 0`) | Audit of both | one data entry, two IDs, or one entry with a note; never renumber |
| F10 | 1.26's audit path is `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Chrome\…` (missing `Google\`): a CIS typo | Audit of 1.26 | use the policy name `OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin`; note it in the matrix |

## 2. How to read the tables

- **Policy = value**: the Chrome policy name and the value CIS requires, in JSON terms. `absent` = the policy must not be set.
- **Why (CIS rationale)**: one line, plain words.
- **Users notice**: from CIS *Impact*. "none (default)" = Chrome already behaves this way.
- **Plan**: first idea only, to be confirmed.
  - `set` = write the policy; low risk.
  - `set (risky)` = write it, but it can break things for users; own toggle with a `# WARNING:`; on by default since D5 was revised 2026-10-08, the site turns it off.
  - `site` = Manual rule whose value the organisation decides: report by default, optional site variable (CLAUDE.md principle 5).
  - `report` = Manual rule, report only.
  - `win?` = probably Windows-only or retired; **verify** in discovery before classifying `na_os`.

## 3. What this means for the role (first read, not decided)

| Topic | Observation | Candidate approach (decide in `design-decisions.md`) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Config mechanism | ~100 of 118 rules are "policy X = value Y" | CLAUDE.md "single declarative artifact" pattern: rules as data in `vars/`, one task renders the managed-policy JSON; skip by rule ID |
| Absent-policy rules | 1.2.1, 1.10–1.12, 1.25–1.27, 1.29, 2.2.5, 2.25 | our JSON simply doesn't contain them; an AUDIT step reports if **another** file in the policy dir sets them |
| Risky rules (`set (risky)`) | 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.1, 2.5.1, 2.12, 2.17, 2.18, 3.1.1, 4.1.1/4.12, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 | own toggle + `# WARNING:` (on by default since 2026-10-08, D5) (mostly L2; 2.3.3 and 2.17 are L1) |
| Manual with a site value (`site`) | 1.2.2, 1.9, 2.3.5, 2.6.1, 2.8.1, 2.8.3, 2.9.1, 2.17, 2.27, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.7, 4.2.8 (+ allowlists for 2.3.3, 2.5.1) | report by default; optional site variable writes the policy. Lists are simple (list of strings), so they fit [keep-options-simple] |
| Not applicable on RHEL (confirmed 2026-10-07) | **16**: Windows-only 2.8.2, 2.10.1, 2.30, 3.13; removed from Chrome 1.10, 1.19, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.3.6, 2.7.1, 2.9.1, 2.23, 2.29, 3.6; Google Update 2.1.1, 2.1.2 | not implemented; evidence: Google's Chrome 155 policy list + VM test ([cis-requirements.md](cis-requirements.md)) |
| Possibly obsolete in current Chrome | 1.10, 2.3.2 (Chrome Apps), 2.3.6 (MV2), 2.9.1 (First-Party Sets), 2.7.1 (Cloud Print) | check `chrome://policy` on the installed version: unknown policies show as errors |
| How to audit effective state | CIS's own check is `chrome://policy` | on RHEL: the JSON file + `chrome://policy` (screenshot/export) or a headless check → discovery |

## 4. Decided

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-10-07 | **Target = Google Chrome (`google-chrome-stable`) on RHEL 8, 9 and 10.** Chromium comes later, as a separate step, only if the benchmark can be applied to it | CIS has a Chrome benchmark but none for Chromium; using the benchmark's own product avoids the "substitute benchmark" mapping for now |
| 2026-10-07 | **Windows-only rules are not implemented.** They are listed as `na_os` in the requirements matrix with evidence (Google's policy list "Supported on"), so the matrix still covers all 118 IDs | the role runs on RHEL only; CIS IDs are kept, never renumbered |
| 2026-10-07 | **Both levels are implemented.** Defaults: `level_1: true`, `level_2: false` (Level 2 = L1 + L2, switched on by the site) | CIS Profile Definitions (PDF p. 14): L1 = "practical and prudent… not inhibit the utility"; L2 = "security more critical than usability… may negatively inhibit the utility". L2 limits features for browser users; it does not lock admins out of the server |
| 2026-10-07 | **Per-rule risk toggles are separate from levels.** A rule that breaks things for users gets its own toggle + `# WARNING:` (on by default since 2026-10-08, D5), whatever its level (as `mongodb8_cis` 2.1/2.2, which are L1 but off). Chrome L1 candidates: 2.3.3 (removes all extensions), 2.17 (proxy) | level = CIS's security/usability profile; the risk toggle = our safety switch for the site |
| 2026-10-07 | **Install is opt-in** (`chrome_cis_install: false`). Not installed and install off → skip message, clean end | same as `mongodb8_cis`; CLAUDE.md "Install is opt-in" |
| 2026-10-07 | **Candidate pattern: data-driven** (one data list of policies in `vars/`, one task writes one JSON policy file), not one task per rule. To be confirmed in discovery and recorded in `design-decisions.md` | all ~100 applicable rules use the same mechanism (policy name = value); MongoDB rules each used different mechanisms |
| 2026-10-07 | **Test VMs = the same 3 Proxmox VMs** (rhel8/9/10, "Server with GUI", MongoDB already on them), new snapshot before Chrome work for rollback | GUI present, so `chrome://policy` can be checked on each OS; Chrome policies don't touch MongoDB |

## 5. Site choices (like MongoDB's opt-in site variables)

Rules where the **site** decides a value. Default = report only (show the current value, change nothing); set the
variable and the role writes it (CLAUDE.md principle 5). Everything else (~95 rules) is a fixed CIS value: no choice.

| Kind | IDs | Input |
|------|-----|-------|
| Pick one value (Manual) | 1.2.2 Safe Browsing level (1 or 2), 1.9 variations (0), 2.6.1 password manager (true/false), 2.8.1 Chrome Remote Desktop (true/false), 2.9.1 First-Party Sets (false) | one value |
| URL / domain list (Manual) | 2.3.5, 2.8.3, 2.27, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.7 (L2), 4.2.8 (L2) | list of strings |
| Automated, but needs a site value | 2.17 proxy mode (`direct` / `system` / `fixed_servers` / `pac_script`, never `auto_detect`) | one value; toggle off until set |
| Allowlist next to a risky blocklist | 2.3.3 `ExtensionInstallAllowlist`, 2.5.1 `NativeMessagingAllowlist` | list of IDs (empty = block all) |
| Not applicable on RHEL (if confirmed) | 2.10.1 (Microsoft cloud sign-in) | — |

## 6. Open questions for you

1. **Site values for the lab:** extension allowlist (2.3.3), proxy mode (2.17), DoH server (4.7), password manager yes/no (2.6.1).


## 7. Next steps (workflow phases)

1. Answer the questions above.
2. Discovery per RHEL 8/9/10 → `platform-notes.md` (package, policy dir, SELinux, Wayland, how to read effective policy).
3. Verify every `win?` / obsolete rule → classification with evidence.
4. Requirements matrix `cis-requirements.md` (one row per rule, Verify command).
5. Design decisions, then build in batches.
